This is audiosniff, a utility to represent network protocols as sound, using 
the BSD speaker driver, or a built-in DSP tone generator on Linux, intended
for use in education, network troubleshooting/debugging, or perhaps even music
composition.

TODO: Still needs a makefile. See compile_command.linux for Linux compilation;
tweak paths and change __LINUX__ to __FREEBSD__, __OPENBSD__, or __NETBSD__ to 
match your system. This distribution is NOT yet thoroughly tested, and
definitely needs cleanup.

To build on Linux, try

    sh < compile_command.linux

Linux version requires portaudio (probably available through your
distribution's package manager). Portaudio doesn't always play well with Pulse.
On Debian, Pulse will generally need to be removed for portaudio applications
to work correctly. Tested and working on i386. amd64, or ARM.

Tone timings may differ on Linux vs. BSD, since the BSD speaker driver has
relatively low-resolution tone durations. In fact, this limitation on BSD has
prevented me from adding representations of things like TCP options and even
packet payloads, since these would cause a hopelessly large backlog of packets
on an active system, and defeat the purpose of providing more or less realtime
monitoring.

On *BSD, make sure esr's speaker driver is compiled into your kernel.

See "man speaker" or "man spkr" or similar.
